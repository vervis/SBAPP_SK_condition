Figure 1. Habitat condition archetype map for the Hardeveld. A value of
one represents 100% similarity to the non-degraded extreme of the
habitat condition archetype while a value of zero represents 100%
similarity to the degraded extreme.

Bell et al. (2021) further calculated what they termed “potential
desertification classes” based on how many standard deviations archetype
values were away from the mean archetype value for the study region.
These can be thought of as “degradation” classes.

Figure 3. Habitat condition archetype map for the Little Karoo A value
of one represents 100% similarity to the non-degraded extreme of the
habitat condition archetype while a value of zero represents 100%
similarity to the degraded extreme.

We can then use the approach suggested by Bell et al. (2021) to derive
“potential desertification classes”.
